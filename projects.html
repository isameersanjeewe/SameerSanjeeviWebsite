The platform gets data from edge devices and provides the user with customised BI thereby helping them improve the operational efficency through direct control of the equipments all remotely. The direct and indrect savings achieved by the user through monitoring and managing their process is what drives thermelgy to enable energy as aservices.<br>
                        As a founding member and a Product Manager, I wore multiple hats from gathering various stakeholder requirements to building Product road maps and managing the entire project. As our project scaled I switched from developing hardware IoT devices to developing an IoT platform / Web Application.</p>

                           <b>Why?</b> <br> 
                            This idea came from a personal problem that I faced during my undergraduate education, due to the curriculum and the very short semester breaks at colleges didn’t provide or encourage students to work on real-time projects at industries that could help in gaining hands-on experience and necessary skills as required for landing a first job.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                           <b>How?</b> <br>

                            To create a platform that will drive on-hand learning experience, mentor them with relevant industry- standard skills to prepare them for the real job market. We decided on conducting a 6-week hack-a-thon where all registered students would be grouped based on their interests and assigned to a mentor who would coach them to work on a real-life project. During the final week we would also introduce the cohort to job searching process, building resume and networking.
                            At the end of it the winner of the hackathon would get an opportunity to intern at one of the companies we partnered with.
